## Gate results

### `source_coverage` — PASS

all non-severe, non-unreliable inventory blocks produced ≥1 KUD item

### `traceability` — PASS

every KUD item has a valid source_block_id

### `artefact_count_ratio` — PASS

KUD items / expected-yield blocks = 279/183 = 1.525 (denominator excludes 70 severely-underspecified blocks) within dispositional-domain target [0.8, 2.2] (dispositional ceiling is PROVISIONAL per 4b-2; next dispositional source may re-trigger review)

### `type3_distribution` — FLAG

dispositional_content_underrepresented: Type 3 items = 17/279 = 6.1% < expected ≥20% for dispositional domain (informational only)

### `no_compound_unsplit` — PASS

every KUD item carries a single knowledge type with consistent column and route

## Stage: source-native progression structure

### `blk_0013` — `classification_unreliable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** KUD classification

**Technical:** The KUD classifier ran 3 times on this source block; fewer than 2/3 runs agreed on the knowledge type (Type 1 / 2 / 3). The block was halted rather than forced into an uncertain classification.

**Pedagogical:** If the classifier can't agree on whether this is declarative knowledge, a skill, or a disposition, the LT derived from it may not accurately reflect the source intent. A teacher should check the original source block and decide the classification manually before using this LT.

### `blk_0199` — `classification_unreliable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** KUD classification

**Technical:** The KUD classifier ran 3 times on this source block; fewer than 2/3 runs agreed on the knowledge type (Type 1 / 2 / 3). The block was halted rather than forced into an uncertain classification.

**Stage:** competency clustering

**Technical:** The cluster_unstable flag means the clustering model's output varied across runs — cluster count or member assignment differed across 3 self-consistency runs. The canonical cluster set was retained using the majority-vote result, but alternative groupings exist.

**Pedagogical:** Cluster instability means the competency groupings may not be the only reasonable arrangement. A teacher reviewing these LTs should check whether each LT genuinely represents one distinct capability, or whether some LTs could reasonably be grouped differently.

### `cluster_04` — `cluster_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** competency clustering

**Technical:** The cluster_unstable flag means the clustering model's output varied across runs — cluster count or member assignment differed across 3 self-consistency runs. The canonical cluster set was retained using the majority-vote result, but alternative groupings exist.

### `cluster_10` — `lt_set_unreliable — only 0/3 runs produced parseable output` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** LT generation

**Technical:** The LT generator ran 3 times on this cluster; fewer than 2/3 runs produced parseable LT output with a consistent count and knowledge-type distribution. No LTs were produced for this cluster.

**Pedagogical:** The source content in this competency cluster did not produce stable learning targets. The content may be too loosely specified, or the cluster may contain content from multiple distinct competencies. A teacher should review the cluster's KUD items and consider manual LT authoring.

### `cluster_14_lt_01` — `lt_set_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** LT generation

**Technical:** The LT generator reached 2/3 agreement on a majority signature, but not 3/3 stability. The LT set was retained using the majority result.

**Pedagogical:** The learning targets in this set are the most consistent description produced, but alternative valid descriptions exist. A teacher reviewing these LTs should be aware that the boundaries between LTs may have shifted in different runs.

### `cluster_14_lt_02` — `lt_set_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** LT generation

**Technical:** The LT generator reached 2/3 agreement on a majority signature, but not 3/3 stability. The LT set was retained using the majority result.

**Pedagogical:** The learning targets in this set are the most consistent description produced, but alternative valid descriptions exist. A teacher reviewing these LTs should be aware that the boundaries between LTs may have shifted in different runs.

### `cluster_14_lt_03` — `lt_set_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Technical:** The LT generator reached 2/3 agreement on a majority signature, but not 3/3 stability. The LT set was retained using the majority result.

**Pedagogical:** The learning targets in this set are the most consistent description produced, but alternative valid descriptions exist. A teacher reviewing these LTs should be aware that the boundaries between LTs may have shifted in different runs.

### `cluster_06_lt_01` — `band_statements_unreliable — 1 format/quality failures` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** band statements

**Technical:** The band statement generator ran 3 times; fewer than 2/3 runs produced parseable output with a consistent signature. No band statements were produced for this LT.

**Pedagogical:** Without band statements, teachers cannot use this LT to assess learners across the source's progression bands. The content may need manual authoring of band-level descriptors.

### `cluster_01_lt_01` — `band_statements_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** band statements

**Technical:** Band statement generation reached 2/3 agreement but not 3/3 stability. The majority-vote statements were retained.

**Pedagogical:** The band-level statements may be rephrased differently in alternative valid runs. The substance is stable but specific wording should be reviewed by a teacher before use.

### `cluster_04_lt_01` — `band_statements_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** band statements

**Technical:** Band statement generation reached 2/3 agreement but not 3/3 stability. The majority-vote statements were retained.

**Pedagogical:** The band-level statements may be rephrased differently in alternative valid runs. The substance is stable but specific wording should be reviewed by a teacher before use.

### `cluster_05_lt_02` — `band_statements_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Technical:** Band statement generation reached 2/3 agreement but not 3/3 stability. The majority-vote statements were retained.

**Pedagogical:** The band-level statements may be rephrased differently in alternative valid runs. The substance is stable but specific wording should be reviewed by a teacher before use.

### `cluster_15_lt_01` — `band_statements_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** band statements

**Technical:** Band statement generation reached 2/3 agreement but not 3/3 stability. The majority-vote statements were retained.

**Pedagogical:** The band-level statements may be rephrased differently in alternative valid runs. The substance is stable but specific wording should be reviewed by a teacher before use.

### `cluster_16_lt_01` — `band_statements_unstable` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** band statements

**Technical:** Band statement generation reached 2/3 agreement but not 3/3 stability. The majority-vote statements were retained.

**Pedagogical:** The band-level statements may be rephrased differently in alternative valid runs. The substance is stable but specific wording should be reviewed by a teacher before use.

### `cluster_02_lt_01` — `gate_unknown` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** criterion rubrics

**Technical:** The rubric generator ran 3 times; fewer than 2/3 runs produced parseable output with a consistent level-signature. No rubric was produced for this LT. This entry is a placeholder flag — no descriptor text is available.

**Pedagogical:** Without a rubric, this LT cannot be used for criterion-referenced assessment. The LT exists in the output and represents a real competency from the source; a teacher can author a rubric manually using the LT name and definition as the starting point.

### `cluster_02_lt_02` — `observable_verb` — **HIGH**

**Stage:** criterion rubrics

**Technical:** The observable_verb gate checks that each applied level descriptor contains at least one verb from the observable-action-verb list (identify, describe, compare, explain, analyse, evaluate, apply, etc.). No observable verb means the level cannot be reliably assessed.

**Pedagogical:** A rubric level with no observable action verb describes a state of being rather than a demonstrable performance. Teachers need observable verbs to assess whether a learner has met each level — without them, the assessment criteria become subjective.

### `cluster_04_lt_01` — `gate_unknown` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** criterion rubrics

**Technical:** The rubric generator ran 3 times; fewer than 2/3 runs produced parseable output with a consistent level-signature. No rubric was produced for this LT. This entry is a placeholder flag — no descriptor text is available.

**Pedagogical:** Without a rubric, this LT cannot be used for criterion-referenced assessment. The LT exists in the output and represents a real competency from the source; a teacher can author a rubric manually using the LT name and definition as the starting point.

### `cluster_06_lt_01` — `single_construct` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** criterion rubrics

**Technical:** The single_construct gate checks that adjacent applied levels (Emerging, Developing, Competent, Extending) share at least one topic-lemma. No topic-lemma overlap between adjacent levels is a signal that the rubric may be describing two different things across the progression.

**Pedagogical:** A rubric where adjacent levels use entirely different vocabulary may be assessing different capabilities at different levels, rather than the same capability at different depths. A teacher reviewing this rubric should check whether the construct is genuinely the same across all levels.

### `cluster_12_lt_02` — `gate_unknown` — **MEDIUM**

**Stage:** criterion rubrics

**Technical:** The rubric generator ran 3 times; fewer than 2/3 runs produced parseable output with a consistent level-signature. No rubric was produced for this LT. This entry is a placeholder flag — no descriptor text is available.
